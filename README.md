# nes-emu
Scope is currently just the 6502 with potential to expand to an NES emulator. A hobby project that I figured would be quite entertaining!!!

Status: At the very early stages currently. I don't even have all of the CPU emulated yet.

  - ^ This is the only references used to understand my project at first and what i need to keep in mind when developing an emulator (in general!). Its what inspired me to start this project because i wanted to do it myself. I needed to know the non obvious things I needed to keep in mind (e.g. emulating bugs) and resources that were available to me such as data sheets and manuals. Anymore than this and the challenge would be lost. Along with the fun!!!! This project is also to test my own knowledge and push myself a little.
